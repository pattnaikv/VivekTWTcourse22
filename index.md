# Why **God** Made Little Boys!

**God** made a world out of his dreams,

                   Of *magic* _mountains_, *oceans* and _streams_.

Of __prairies__ and _plains_ and _wooded land_,

                   Then he thought, I need someone to stand.

To watch the _sunlight_ up the sky,

                   To see the nestlings, learn to fly.

To watch the __squirrel__ hide her nuts, and

                    Hear the wind whistle its thoughts.

To chase a glow worm’s tiny lantern,

                    And steal all joy from nature’s cistern.

To watch a **dove’s** pristine plumes,

                    And dance to the river’s merry tunes.

To cower at the sea wave’s ruthless gyration.

                    And smell the dew kissed fragrant carnation.

So **God** made creatures tiny and nice and,

                    Put them in charge of **Oceans** and **7 skies**.

After having created ‘__Boys__’ full of fun,

                    He thought _“That’s a job well done”_.


                                                     **__VIVEK PATTNAIK__**
