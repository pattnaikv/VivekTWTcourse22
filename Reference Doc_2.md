# We are like this only : Seven Indian isms every writer should avoid

1. **_Your Good name please :It is the direct translation of the Hindi form " Aap ka shubh Naam kya hai " , Shubh meaning "good" . This sentence is used in a way as if there is also some evil before our name as well ._**

2. **Okay : The translation for the hindi line: Theek hai " . This line is used after every sentence as if we need to ensure that the person we are speaking with understands everything we are telling them without any miss.**

3. _Challan : "Receipt" : Receipt for Goods, Medical Receipt. This word is used without any hesitance whatsoever even at professional levels_

4. Only : "I am here only " , "The Table is there only " . This sentence is used in a way as if we dont wanna make a sentence feel lonely. 

5. **The backside Entrance: meaning the rear side of a building . Here  backside is used in a way as if the building has buttocks as well .**

6. Xerox: The Indian Synonym for " Photocopy " . Since the xerox machine is used to get a duplicate of some content we are bound to use "xerox" in place of "photocopy" .

7. _Cent Percent: Meaning 100 % . She received cent percent marks in the Exam ._
