They say" **True Love"** doesn't die. I say the same.
Is it eternal? Yes, it is.

_You just need to believe, have faith and little patience._

[Is it possible that we can love a person forever?](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-love-2795343)
Well, it can be possible.

Of course we can.

_Give us a reason they asked, why should we love someone with all our heart?_

**I want to tell the world "True love"can happen. Yes "True". Love can happen to all, true love happens once in a lifetime.**

_I have a story, the story of a beautiful soul, that creates beauty around people.._

**She gave me a thousand reasons to believe in true love..**
